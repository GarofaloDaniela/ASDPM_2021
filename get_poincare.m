function [SD1, SD2, SD_ratio, SD_prod, Var, coeff, x, y]=get_poincare(hrv)
% Computes SD1 and SD2 [ms] as well as providing an ellipse E_c centered in the x-y
% mean of the poincare plot. In addition it returns the variances resulted
% from the application of pca in the column vector Var [s2], in which the first
% row refers to SD2 and the second to SD1. coeff are the eigenvalues of the
% pca. SD1 and SD2 are obtained through the application of Principal
% Component Analysis of the scatter plot.
